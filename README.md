# Angular-Express Authentication Starter: JWT-Based Secure Login System

Boilerplate project that integrates Angular and Express for user authentication. It features a login system where users enter credentials, which are validated by an Express backend using bcrypt. A JWT token is generated and returned to the frontend, where it is stored and used to manage authentication state through an Angular service and BehaviorSubject, ensuring UI updates.
